## TuruApp Mobile (Android) Documentation
<p>This is repository of project capstone Bangkit C23 - PR493 for mobile develop using kotlin and android studio. </p>
We have developed Turu, a platform that helps users track their sleep schedule and journal their dreams. Turu incorporates a unique "sleep to earn" business model that rewards users for following their sleep schedule and achieving their sleep goals. Our platform provides a painkiller solution by motivating users to prioritize their sleep and adopt healthier sleep habits. We believe that Turu can make a significant impact by providing users with the tools and motivation they need to achieve better sleep habits and improve their quality of life.
